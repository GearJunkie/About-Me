          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>I was born and raised in Washington state. I enlisted into the US Army after finishing high school, and served 4 years whlie stationed at Fort Bragg. I met my wife Cara in Virginia, and we have been living here ever since. I've always been interested in computers and gaming consoles. I have even built a couple of computers myself, but I have never worked with software from a developer standpoint. After working in healthcare for quite a long time, I'm looking forward to a career change. Software development is a career that I'm looking forward to very much, and my education and training at Code Fellows is going great! My hobbies mostly include outdoor activities, in addition to; gaming, theatre, and cooking.</p>
