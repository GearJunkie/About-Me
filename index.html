        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <section class="bio">
          <p>I was born and raised in Washington state. I enlisted into the US Army after finishing high school, and served 4 years whlie stationed at Fort Bragg. I met my wife Cara in Virginia, and we have been living here ever since. I've always been interested in computers and gaming consoles. I have even built a couple of computers myself, but I have never worked with software from a developer standpoint. After working in healthcare for quite a long time, I'm looking forward to a career change. Software development is a career that I'm looking forward to very much, and my education and training at Code Fellows is going great! My hobbies mostly include outdoor activities, in addition to; gaming, theatre, and cooking.</p>

Then I continued my training at Airborne School to become a paratrooper. Finally my formal training in the military involved becoming a Sapper (an advanced Combat Engineer), where I honed my skills with demolitions, and combat operations. I went to college after my military service to become an EMT/Paramedic, where I earned a degree in EMS, along with many training certifications in advanced life-saving skills. I continued my college education to include nursing. Since my recent decision to change careers, I am currently training to become a software developer at the Code Fellows Tech Academy. </p>

I absolutely loved this experience, even though there were hardships that I endured during wartime. My priorities and perspective changed towards the end of my enlistment terms, and I decided to close that chapter in my life. After my military service, I worked as an armed security officer for GS4/Wackenhut a short while, which I did not enjoy at all. Following that, I started working as a carpenter's apprentice. I really enjoyed working building and tinkering, and seeing the results of my hard work. But hard times came upon that industry following the economic crisis then, and so I needed to find a more stable career for myslef. That led me to go to college. During that time, I worked in outdoor sports retail at Eastern Mountain Sports. Once I finished college, I became a Paramedic, and enjoyed working in emergency departments for the last 12 years. Following the pandemic, I was facing burn-out and financial struggles because many hospitals were scaling back the staffing hours. Something that I did not see coming as a healtcare worker during a pandemic. I decided it was time to make a change for myself. I've always been interested in Tech, but never immersed myself into it before. This interest led my decision to enroll into Code Fellows and become a software developer.</p>

It takes hard work and determination to learn a new career at any point in one's life. My goal as a junior-level software developer is to get a job in my area with a well-established company that focuses on teamwork. </p>
