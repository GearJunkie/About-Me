## Project Name - About Me

this is a simple webpage that shares some information to get to know who I am. I've included some prompts that ask for the user's name, which displays their name and a message on a sticky. I've also created some yes or no questions for the user to answer, as well as a couple of guessing games. Lastly I alert the user of how many questions they got right.

### Reflections and Comments
This was a difficult project as a beginner developer. I was exposed to so much content, that it felt overwhelming at times. But with some determination, and guidance from my instructors, TA's, and fellow classmates, I succeeded in getting a basic knowledge and understanding.
